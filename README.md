# Hey there 👋

I’m [Nawaz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) , a full-stack dev from India who loves turning random ideas into things that actually work.
If something sparks my curiosity, I’ll probably prototype it and tweak it before I realize I skipped lunch.

I mostly work with JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, and whatever else helps me build fast. Lately, I’ve been exploring the AI side of full-stack development — LangChain, LangGraph, vector databases, and all the fun stuff that makes apps feel smarter and a little more alive.

I’ve built all kinds of projects: AI bots, resume tools, dashboards, tiny experiments that solve oddly specific problems, and mini 10 minute games that happen because I opened Godot “just to check something.”

You can find my favorite work in my pinned repos — they show exactly what I enjoy building.

### Fun Facts:

* I read a lot (personality development, fiction, finance, whatever keeps me hooked)
* I play skill-based games and usually take the hardest route for no reason
* I enjoy building small projects just to see what’s possible
* I make small games in Godot whenever inspiration hits
* I randomly search for new wallpapers (please dont ask why)
